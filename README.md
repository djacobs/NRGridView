##What is NRGridView

NRGridView is a grid-view UI component (built as a static library) which has been developed by Louka Desroziers, for Novedia Regions.
How it works? Almost like UITableView works. You set a dataSource, and a delegate.. and you implement all @required methods.
It also has a 'layoutStyle'. It means you can use it as a vertical gridView, or horizontal grid-view!

If you got any suggestions, or if you need any furthermore UITableView-like methods (like -scrollToItemAtIndexPath:animated:, or whatever), do not hesitate to email me at l.desroziers@novediagroup.com
